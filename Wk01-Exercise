    "## Background\n",
    "Diguanylate cyclase/phosphodiesterase A (DGC/PDEA) is a family of genes often implicated in the formation of biofilm. These genes are characterized by a pair of tandem GGDEF-EAL domains. The interplay between DGC and PDEA is often antagonistic. DGC synthesizes c-di-GMP from two molecules of GTP, a second messenger that upregulates a host of pathways involved in biofilm formation, whereas PDEA hydrolyzes c-di-GMP.\n",
    "![Interplay between DGC and PDEA](http://jb.asm.org/content/191/3/683/F1.medium.gif)\n",
    "The dynamics between DGC and PDEA is further complicated by the observation that both genes often contain the same pair of tandem GGDEF-EAL domain, and prediction of exact protein activity based on sequence is not always reliable. Although there does seem to be a pattern in that, a well-conserved GGDEF domain is responsible for the diguanylate cyclase activity and an EAL domain is responsible for the phosphodiesterase A activity"
